# Tlang
A basic turing complete treewalk interpreted language, heavily inspired by javascript syntax, written in C++. You can declare a variable using the `let` keyword, and print it using the `print` keyword. All the basic keywords of any programming language are also present, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, etc. The language does not support classes. The grammar can be found in `grammar.txt`, the build binaries in `bin/Debug`. The project was built using codeblocks.
# Usage
To interpret a program written in tlang, you simply run the interpreter in a CLI and supply the file you want to interpret as the only argument. Example: `./tlang.exe ./test.input`
